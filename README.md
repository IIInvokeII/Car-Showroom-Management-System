# Car-Showroom-Management-System
Repository holding the front end and back end code for the application

This was developed for my Database Management Systems and Applications Course.

While coding, I thought more than twice why I was using Visual Basic. 
At this point of development, I had no front end nor back end development experience. Visual basic was simple and provided forms for an easily codeable front end.
Oracle 11g, understandably is not the best database software in existence, but served well for the purpose of this project: Learning the core of what even a front end or a back end is.
